# Project Ordering

Projects in the `projects` array in `public/site.json` must be sorted by date **descending** (most recent at the top, oldest at the bottom).

- Sort by `years.end` first (higher = more recent = earlier in the array)
- If `years.end` is equal, sort by `years.start` descending
- After updating any project's dates, re-sort the entire `projects` array to maintain this order
